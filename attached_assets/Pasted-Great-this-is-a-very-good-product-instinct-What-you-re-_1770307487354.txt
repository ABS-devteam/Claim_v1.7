Great, this is a very good product instinct. What you’re describing is a classic “cold start + auth race” problem, and you’re right: the current UX makes it feel broken even when it isn’t.

I’ll break this into three parts:

What’s actually going wrong (technically)

The UX changes that fix it (conceptually)

High-quality Replit prompts you can copy/paste to implement this cleanly

I’ll also give you a concrete loading-screen spec in your turquoise theme.

1️⃣ What’s actually causing the blank / long load

Based on your app and Farcaster context, this is almost certainly happening:

The current flow (problematic)

App mounts

useFarcaster() initializes SDK (async)

UI immediately checks:

isSDKLoaded

wallet?.isConnected

If either is false, you render:

blank screen

or connect wallet screen

Meanwhile:

Farcaster auto-restores session

wallet does connect a moment later

Result:

flicker

blank screen

sometimes never re-renders correctly

This is a race condition, not a wallet problem.

2️⃣ The correct UX model (what you want instead)
✅ New mental model

There should be three app phases, not two:

Phase	What’s happening	What user sees
Boot	SDK loading, wallet restoring, permissions resolving	Loading screen
Ready	Wallet resolved (connected or not)	App content
Error	SDK failed or timeout	Friendly retry
❌ What you should remove

The “Connect Wallet” gate screen

Any UI that assumes the wallet must be manually connected

In Farcaster:

If the user has already granted permission, you should auto-connect silently.

3️⃣ UX changes you want to introduce
✅ Change 1: Skip the connect wallet screen

Instead of this logic:

if (!wallet?.isConnected) {
  return <ConnectWalletScreen />
}


You want:

Always attempt auto-connect

Only show an error if it fails after a timeout

✅ Change 2: Add a proper loading screen

This screen should show when any of these are true:

SDK not loaded

Wallet connection pending

Token data fetching

Claimable fees fetching

This replaces the “blank” state entirely.

4️⃣ Turquoise loading screen spec (matches your brand)
Visual spec

Background: #F2FBFA

Foreground: dark ink (#0F2A3D)

Accent: brand turquoise (#2FCFC3)

Style: clean, retro-inspired, not noisy

Behavior

Shows for 300–800ms minimum (avoid flicker)

Progress can be:

indeterminate (animated)

or fake progress that completes when data is ready

5️⃣ EXACT Replit prompts to implement this cleanly

These are written to force correct architecture, not hacks.

🔴 PROMPT 1 — Fix blank screen & loading race (USE FIRST)

The app sometimes loads blank or takes too long to connect in a Farcaster environment.

I want you to:

Identify all async initialization steps (SDK load, wallet restore, permission check, data fetch)

Detect race conditions between SDK readiness and wallet state

Replace conditional rendering that causes blank screens

Propose a single source of truth for “app is ready” and ensure the UI never renders an empty state.

🟠 PROMPT 2 — Remove connect wallet screen safely

I want to remove the explicit “Connect Wallet” screen.

The app should:

Attempt silent auto-connect on load

Assume the user has already granted permission in Farcaster

Only show an error if auto-connect fails after a timeout (e.g. 5 seconds)

Modify the flow so the app always boots into a loading state first, not a connect screen.
